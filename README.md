## React App Setup

### Install Npm

Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/).
Once Node.js is installed, open your command prompt (for Windows users) or terminal (for Mac and Linux users).
Verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly by typing the following commands:

	node -v

	npm -v

If these commands return version numbers, it means that Node.js and npm are installed correctly.
If you need to update npm to the latest version, you can do so by typing the following command:

    npm install -g npm

This will install the latest version of npm globally on your system.

That's it! You have successfully installed npm on your system. You can now use npm to manage packages and dependencies for your Node.js projects.

### Create react app

Write a command using the CLI to create a react app: 

	npx create-react-app frontend

## Wallet Setup

To download MetaMask, please follow these steps:
1. Go to the MetaMask website: https://metamask.io/
2. Click on "Download" in the menu at the top of the page.
3. Select the version that corresponds to your web browser. MetaMask is available for Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Edge.
4. Click the "Add to Chrome" or "Add to Firefox" button to start the download process.
5. After the download is complete, open your web browser and click on the MetaMask icon in the top right corner of your browser.
6. Follow the instructions to set up your MetaMask account and create a new wallet.
7. Make sure to write down your seed phrase and store it in a safe place. This is the only way to recover your MetaMask wallet if you lose access to your device.

That's it! You are now ready to use MetaMask to interact with decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Blockchain for developers

At the core of a blockchain is a cryptographic ledger managed by nodes which can be run on any computer, or by miners. It is these nodes that power the blockchain. Every transaction that occurs is stored and encrypted as a hash. These hashes are then stored in combinations as a block. Every node will then submit their block hashes to the network, and if they don't match that means they contain invalid ledger history, and are rejected and overwritten by the correct block. 

Blockchains that support smart contracts also store state data. The advantage to all of this is that these nodes operate independently, and effectively provide a hosted application environment that is completely distributed. This is what we're talking about when we talk about decentralization. Because these nodes are hosted by anyone anywhere, it means there's no central point of failure. For example, when China banned Bitcoin mining, the Bitcoin network didn't have regional downtime, it just routed transactions to the nodes that were still operating. This same system also provides redundancy.

Apart from transactions, other things happen on the blockchain that are done via smart contracts. This includes tokens, NFTs, blockchain data storage, complex transactions, and really just about anything you can come up with using smart contracts.

Everything that happens on the blockchain is public and immutable. This means that everything that happens including coding mistakes are all in plain sight. You can view things on the blockchain at [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/). And if you look at this website you can look up any address, transactions and see what's happened, and determine other things that are going on on the blockchain.

Blockchain technology is decentralized immutable, redundant, and public. It was created to handle transactions securely that can't be spoofed and on a network that isn't subject to outages.

## Decentralization and Web3 opportunities

DeFi or decentralized finance, tokenization, NFTs, DAOs or decentralized autonomous organizations, gaming applications, and other types of decentralized applications or DApps. 

Decentralized finance or DeFi is blockchain banking. DeFi apps range from lending D apps to ways to earn crypto through staking or liquidity pool farming.

Ethereum and other blockchains have standards to create your own tokens. This can be done for a variety of reasons, from awards to utility to governance, and is typically referred to as tokenization. Non fungible tokens or NFTs utilize tokenization, to make tokens not for spending but for tracking digital elements on the blockchain. These are often used for art but can also be used as access keys in many other use cases. 

Decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs utilize the trustless nature of the blockchain to bring groups together to do a variety of tasks from investment groups to social groups to well, buying the US constitution. 

By using tokens or NFTs for access and enabling public voting on chain, you don't need to know people in the group to be able to trust in the process.

Many new play to earn games are arising where you can earn crypto from playing them. Additionally, in game items can be purchased and traded as NFTs. And there are even entire virtual worlds like Decentraland in what many are calling the metaverse. 

Blockchain technology is not only limited to cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), but also provides a decentralized network that can be used to create various types of decentralized apps (DApps). These DApps eliminate the need for intermediaries, enabling users to perform financial transactions and other functions directly through the network. It transforms the way we interact financially and socially, a new internet is emerging that allows for the creation of innovative DApps, tokens, and NFTs.

### DeFi

Decentralized finance is the processing of financial transactions on the blockchain. This can remove the need for a central resource or organization to handle the processing. The general concept behind DeFi is that the current financial system sometimes called CeFi or centralized finance, forces us to rely on banks, insurance companies, escrow companies, brokers and central exchanges to invest, borrow, loan and make transactions. Ultimately, these institutions make considerable money, but provide little by way of service. The de-central and transactional nature of the blockchain opens up the opportunity to completely eliminate these institutions, and in turn, empower the participants to earn and save money. By empowering people for example, to make peer-to-peer loans, the interest earned by banks can now be earned directly by individuals, and the market will dictate the rates. Additionally, new options for collateralization, and trust make credit scores and similar tools unnecessary. Is is risky, but there are also high rewards. If you lend in cryptocurrency, you are inherently subject to the volatility of the coin you're lending. This could also be a risk as it could be more difficult for the borrower to return the payment. New lending models and methodologies evolve every day. So it will likely be that as this area matures there are options at varying levels of risk. Low risk options based on stable coins, and collateral or blockchain-based credit ratings, and higher risk options on more volatile coins, and higher risk borrowers. The options are bound for anyone looking to grow their income on the blockchain. Many coins offer staking or stacking opportunities where your coins will be locked up for a set timeframe, and in return, you'll receive more of the same or related coins back. The amount varies on the coin, and often on the risk and volatility associated. Additionally, decentralized exchanges, and DeFi apps like Uniswap, Pancakeswap, Sushiswap and Alice, allow users to participate in swap fees by contributing to liquidation pools. They can even stake their liquidity stakes to earn more interest. At the heart of all DeFi is the smart contract, are blockchain programming that can enable the blockchain to intelligently handle currency, holding currency from one wallet, releasing currency to another all through functions that are directly saved to the blockchain as are all of the transactions that they make. - DeFi provides a virtually unlimited way to do financial transactions. There are lending apps, ways to earn interest through staking and farming, and many more opportunities to disrupt the traditional centralized finance industry.
