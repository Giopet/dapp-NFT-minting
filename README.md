## React App Setup

### Install Npm

Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/).
Once Node.js is installed, open your command prompt (for Windows users) or terminal (for Mac and Linux users).
Verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly by typing the following commands:

	node -v

	npm -v

If these commands return version numbers, it means that Node.js and npm are installed correctly.
If you need to update npm to the latest version, you can do so by typing the following command:

    npm install -g npm

This will install the latest version of npm globally on your system.

That's it! You have successfully installed npm on your system. You can now use npm to manage packages and dependencies for your Node.js projects.

### create react app

Write a command using the CLI to create a react app: 

	npx create-react-app frontend
